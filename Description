This is a simple Client/Server app which showcases Angular as a front end client, and Node + Express + Sequelize as a backend using Postgresql as the database.

You will need postgresql installed, or if you are using a different database you will need to change some code around.

THE APP:

Create a table called customers automatically upone initialization of the server and fills it with object.
When you run the client it will speak to the server.
